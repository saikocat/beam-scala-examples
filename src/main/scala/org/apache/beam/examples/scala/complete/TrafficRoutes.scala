/**
  * A Beam Example that runs in both batch and streaming modes with traffic sensor data. You can
  * configure the running mode by setting --streaming to true or false.
  *
  * Concepts: The batch and streaming runners, GroupByKey, sliding windows.
  *
  * This example analyzes traffic sensor data using SlidingWindows. For each window, it calculates
  * the average speed over the window for some small set of predefined 'routes', and looks for
  * 'slowdowns' in those routes. It writes its results to a BigQuery table.
  *
  * The pipeline reads traffic sensor data from --inputFile.
  *
  * The example is configured to use the default BigQuery table from the example common package
  * (there are no defaults for a general Beam pipeline). You can override them by using the
  * --bigQueryDataset, and --bigQueryTable options. If the BigQuery table do not exist,
  * the example will try to create them.
  *
  * The example will try to cancel the pipelines on the signal to terminate the process (CTRL-C)
  * and then exits.
